Read what clients have to say:

> As many of my subscribers won't be too technical with computers, or use facebook/twitter etc., I was looking for a plug in that would be easy to use from a subscribers point of view. This works very well - the subscriber doesn't have to mess about with member settings and completing a profile etc, or have to opt out of categories, tags and such...they only have to enter their name and email address in a widget or page where the shortcode has been placed, then later click a link in a confirmatory email, and they're all set up to receive new posts updates. SIMPLE and effective. Well done to the developer, this is great as it's flexible and easy for the webmaster to set up and customise, but more importantly it's end user friendly.

And here's another customer's review:

> I have tried quite a few subscribe by email type plugins and this by far blows them all out of the water. Beautiful emails and and great backend design for the admin. This works so nice and works well with SMTP solutions
> - [Mike Price](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-email-subscriber-plugin)

And one more:

> This works very well indeed... It does all the necessary things for a newsletter/email list(s)... It is simple, clean, easy to engage, and looks good... I was also easily able to do some styling on the input forms by adding its widget css into my child's style.css file and add and/or change some properties and values... Thanks much for making this available and staying on top of it... :-)
